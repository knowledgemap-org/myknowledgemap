    <h1>Welcome to the personal knowledge map project site</h1>
    <p>This project aims to provide a tool that help each one of us to progress in aquiring knowledge.<br/>
     The idea is to show a map of all the domains of knowledge with an enlighted zone showing what we already know and
     path to what we can learn.<br/>
     By selecting the path we are led to resources (articles, videos,...) that allow to aquire the knowledge and to evaluate its acquisition,
     hence extending its knowledge zone.<br/>
     By selecting a specific subject, the map can show paths that lead to it from your knowledge zone.
    </p>
    <p>Obviously the knowledge zone is personal data, and it is not the role of this site to store them.
    Personal data can be loaded from any storage you own or have access to.
    </p>
    <p>The way the subject are represented as a map is not universal. It depends in several factors that are subjective, like what is a knowledge subject
     what is its relation to other subjects (inclusion is important to be able to zoom in the map), what are the path between subjects.<br/>
     This site do not impose any answer to those questions, although all the subject, their relations, their path are handled and stored in this site,
     the one you decide to use or not are part of your personal data.
     For instance you can remove astrology or flatness of the earth from the list of subjects and still use the map.
    </p>
